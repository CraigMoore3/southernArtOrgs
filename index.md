Hello,

My name is Craig Moore, I'm an undergraduate Fine Arts Student at Florida State University working with the Expanded Media Lab. I'm reaching out to ask about any current or future plans **SITE131** has for hosting open-calls for artist submissions.

I'm collaborating with a group of my peers to compile a database of opportunities for emerging artists in the South and your space caught our attention.

Additionally, if you're aware of any other resources in the greater **Dallas** area, they would be greatly appreciated!

If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best,
Craig Moore
